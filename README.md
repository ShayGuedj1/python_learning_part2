# python_learning_part2

## This section is my first step of my journey.

### In this code I learned:
* How to write classes.
* How to write functions.
* How to write methods.
* How to call functions and methods.
* How to debug my code.
* How to orgenize my code.

## The code includes:
* A class named "Boss"
* A subclasses named "GoodBoss" & "BadBoss"
* Two methods for each boss. The methods print good or bad scentences, depending on the boss atitude.
* A main page where the code is executed.

##### The main page has two bosses (Julian and Bob).
##### While Julian is the good boss, Bob is the bad boss, and the main function imports the "Boss" class and gives us the option to select the parameters of each one of them.
